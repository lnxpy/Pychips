with Pychips you can make you'r picture by playing with matrises ans arrays!<br>
you can run setup.py and watch the result (of installation of cv and numpy)<br>
Pychips uses the Numpy Arrays Because cv2.imread() function can get input by Array patterns.<br>
<br>
Tip : in this version you can make Black & White pictures!<br>
you can install the Opencv and numpy manually!<br>
